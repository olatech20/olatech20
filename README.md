I'm very passionate about Software Engineering and the vast possibilities in the world of Tech! 

I've recently began my software engineering career at ALX Holberton School of Software Engineering, which is a yearlong program. I am really happy to have started this journey.

“ The ALX Holberton Software Engineering programme is a 12-month(70h/week) immersive programme that engages technology enthusiasts and budding software engineers in a variety of programmes across in-demand tech disciplines to prepare them for a global career as a Full-Stack Developer. “

Of course, I'll keep on updating this summary as I augment and add to my skill-sets in Tech!
